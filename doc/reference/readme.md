# Reference Documentation

This is the reference documentation for Gerbil.
We try to exhaustively document the core prelude, runtime builtins, and the standard library.

Nonetheless, we do not (re)document core Scheme and Gambit provided primitives, as there
is already extensinve high quality documentation for these topics:
- For documentation pertaining to core Scheme primitives, see
  [R5RS](https://schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/HTML/)
- For documentation pertaining to Gambit provided primitives, see the
  [Gambit Manual](https://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~gambit/doc/gambit.html).
