;; R7RS spec:
;; (guard (variable cond-clause ...) body ...)
;; "Semantics: The body is evaluated with an exception han-
;;  dler that binds the raised object (see raise in section 6.11)
;;  to variable and, within the scope of that binding, evalu-
;;  ates the clauses as if they were the clauses of a cond ex-
;;  pression. That implicit cond expression is evaluated with
;;  the continuation and dynamic environment of the guard
;;  expression. If every cond clauseâ€™s test evaluates to #f
;;  and there is no else clause, then raise-continuable is
;;  invoked on the raised object within the dynamic environ-
;;  ment of the original call to raise or raise-continuable,
;;  except that the current exception handler is that of the
;;  guard expression."
;;
;; There is no raise-continiuable per se in Gerbil on Gambit
;; [see comments on raise-continuable stub] but this macro
;; is still usable by implementing in the following manner

;; R7RS spec:
;; "Raises an exception by invoking the current exception han-
;;  dler on obj . The handler is called with the same dynamic
;;  environment as the call to raise-continuable, except
;;  that: (1) the current exception handler is the one that was
;;  in place when the handler being called was installed, and
;;  (2) if the handler being called returns, then it will again
;;  become the current exception handler."
;;
;; This CANNOT be implemented without kernel changes in Gambit
;; as the previous exception handler is not accessible anywhere
;; but hidden on the local stack frame at the time of installation.
;; On the same time, all Gambit exceptions are continuable in the
;; sense that the exception handler can return, it just happens
;; that the current exception handler is itself during its invocation
;; So it will remain a stub; seek professional help if you need this in
;; a library module.
